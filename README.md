# Kingklip-Genomics

Allele frequency file of biallelic SNPs, identified based on a minimum count of four, a minimum coverage of 20 and a maximum coverage of 500 reads > "MAA.420500.txt"
Input allele frequency files for corresponding "Full" (MAA.FULL.txt), "Neutral" (MAA.NEUTRAL.txt) and "Outlier" (MAA.OUTLIER.txt) datasets used for population sub-structuring analyses (Minimum count of 4,minimum coverage of 28 and maximum coverage of 100).
Scripts used for bioinformatic analyses and pipeline > "Scripts.txt"
R-script, "PopStructure.R", used for estimates of pairwise differentiation levels, using the 'diffCalc' command of diveRsity (Keenan et al.,2013).
